  //This module helps us take a prepare a json result set of search results and parse them into useable objects.

 //=================================================================================================== ===========
 //We get out results as a series of Succes or Error cases where each Success contains a string repr.
 //of json array of objects.  The series of Success or Failure cases is the aggregation of a
 //a Fork-join parallel function of all the search requests we've passed to it.

 //The json results may represent a variation of TPassClients. Visitors, Student, Employees etc.
 //The json parser can't really figure out which types to convert these into at this point and so we must
 //prepare the data first by lending a hand with some parsing.
 //=================================================================================================== ===========
 //Parsing steps.
 // Split the string by its end } bracket which denotes the end of an object.
 // This gives us an array of json objects repr as strings,at this point the obj format is not correct so we fix that
 // See parse_search_result_function.
 // After the array of json strings is in proper object format we examine each one and convert it into a proper
 // TPassClient object.
 // We then Group the TPass client objects into their respective Types and return a grouped result for further processing
